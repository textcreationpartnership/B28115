            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Repl.</note>As to your first Rule we Answer, <hi>(1.)</hi> It is one thing to impose in General, That <hi>all be done decently, and in order.</hi> This God himself hath imposed by his Apostle: And it's another thing to impose in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, That this, or that, be used as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and Orderly. Concerning this we add, it is in the Text said, <hi>Let it be done,</hi> but not let it be imposed: Yet from other Scriptures, we doubt not but Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of meer Decency, and Order, (as determined Time, Place, Ʋtensils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are common to Things Civil and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, though not the Symbolical Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which afterwards we confute) may be imposed with the necessary Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Limitations afterward laid down. But, <hi>(1.)</hi> If any Ʋsurpers will pretend a Power from Christ, to impose such Things on the Church; though the Things be lawful, we must take heed how we acknowledge an Ʋsurped Power by Formal Obedience. <hi>(2.)</hi> A just Power may impose them, but to just Ends, as the preservation and success of the modified Worship or Ordinances. And if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conduce not to those Ends, they sin in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104659:5"/> imposing them. <hi>(3.)</hi> Yet the Subjects are bound to obey a true Authority in such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, where the Matter belongs to the Cognizance and Office of the Ruler, and where the Mistake is not so great, as to bring greater Mischiefs to the Church, than the suspending of our Active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would do. <hi>(4.)</hi> But if these Things be determined, under pretence of Order and Decency, to the plain destruction of the Ordinances modified, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended End, they cease to be Means, and we must not use them. <hi>(5.)</hi> Or if under the names of Things Decent and of Order, Men will meddle with Things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to their Office; as to institute a new Worship for God, new Sacraments, or any Thing forbidden in the General Prohibition of <hi>Adding,</hi> or <hi>Diminishing;</hi> This is an Ʋsurpation, and not an Act of Authority; and we are bound, in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, to disobey them. <hi>(6.)</hi> Where Governours may command at set Times, and by proportionable Penalties enforce, if they command when it will destroy the End, or enforce by such Penalties as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy or cross it, they greatly sin by such Commands. Thus we have more distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given you our Sense about the Matter of your first Rule.</p>

                        <p>And since when Things are <hi>done</hi> as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,</hi> as God himself does either medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, or immediately require.

                           </gap>, in which the Emphasis of the Precept does chiefly lye.

                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, What they presently adde, (It is said in the Text, <hi>Let it be done,</hi> but not, <hi>let it be imposed;</hi>) we should
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104659:7"/> not have expected indeed from <hi>any,</hi> much less from <hi>them,</hi> who had so openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in the words going before, <hi>That this, God himself hath imposed by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For, (1.) Can they think the <hi>Word</hi> of God so contrariant to his <hi>Will,</hi> that what he <hi>imposeth</hi> on men <hi>himself,</hi> himself will have to be <hi>not imposed?</hi> Or dare they say <hi>He imposeth not simply,</hi> what they say, <hi>He imposeth by his Apostle?</hi> Or is it not lawful for their <hi>Superiors,</hi> whom God hath commanded them to obey, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon <hi>them</hi> for their Observance, what they acknowledge is <hi>imposed by God himself?</hi> This were a peevishness unexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, to <hi>disobey</hi> the Command of <hi>God,</hi> for it's being inforced by that of <hi>Men;</hi> and even by <hi>that Rank</hi> of Men, whom God hath invested with a Power, to <hi>punish</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory Men for their <hi>disobedience.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Who cannot by Impudence it self, be affirmed to obey an <hi>usurp't Authority,</hi> whilst we obey that <hi>Authority</hi> by which our Liturgy is injoyn'd.

                        <p>Had they the Courage to have given a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical Answer, or had they not? If they had, two words would have served to let us know, whether they consented, or not consented.

It is by the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, to wit, the King, that Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Clergy (consisting not of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops only) do gain the force of a Law to their Constitutions.

                        <p>To your <hi>Third Rule</hi> we add, It is first considerable what the thing is, and then how it is apprehended, if it be lawfull, and well commanded, and to be obeyed, It is no Ignorance, Doubt, or Errour of the Subject that can exempt him from the Duty of obeying; but it may ensnare him in a certainty of sinning, whether he obey
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104659:15"/> or disobey: For as God commandeth him to obey, and also not to do that which Man commandeth, when God forbiddeth it; so he obligeth the Erroneous, first to lay down his Errours, and so to obey. But if a Thing be forbidden of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of Man, and one man erroneous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinks it lawful, and that he should obey, and another is in doubt between both, it is neither a Duty, nor lawful for either of them here to obey: For Man's Errour changeth not God's Law, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligeth himself from obedience; but this man's Duty is both to lay by that Errour, and to refuse obedience: But if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be only of the Order of such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Duty, we Answer; If the Thing be really lawful, and obedience and duty, then he that doubteth, or erreth, should if possible, suddenly lay by his Errours, or Doubt, and so obey; but if that cannot be, he should first go about the fittest means, for his better information, till he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and so obey. And so on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if really the Thing commanded be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; if he be sure of it, he must resolve against it; if he hesitate, he is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allowed to do a Thing forbidden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is ignorant: For his Ignorance is supposed culpable it self; but he is first to consult, and use the best means for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, 'till he know the Truth, and in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104659:16"/> the mean time to suspend his Act. But yet because of humane Frailty, between several Faults, we must consider, when we cannot avoid all that we would, in what Order most safely to watch, and to avoid them. And so when I have done my best, and cannot discern whether a Command be just, and the Thing lawful or not; If it have the face of Idolatry, Blasphemy, or some hainous sin, that is Commanded, &amp; our Disobedience have the Appearance, but of an effect of involuntary Ignorance, it is more excusable in us to fear the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sin, and so to suspend, 'till we are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfied, than to do that which we suspect, to be so heinous a sin, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it prove no sin; so on the contrary, if our Disobedience be like to bring Infamy or Calamity on the Church, and our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience appear to be but about a very small sin, if we doubt of it, it is more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable to obey, than to disobey, though both be faulty, supposing the thing indeed to be unlawful, and we discern it not.</p>
                        <p>So that your Rule of obeying, where you are not as sure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an unsure Rule, unless as we have fullier cautioned it.</p>

                        <p>Our <hi>Third Rule</hi> it seems is so every way Cogent,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists third Rule defended.</note> that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> do not gainsay it by any means; but only <hi>add</hi> several things, which partly add to its Confirmation, and partly are nothing to the purpose, for which they would be thought to use them.</p>
                        <p>First, They luckily confess (and we thank them for it) That if the Matter of the Canon be really <hi>lawful, and well commanded, and to be obeyed, it is no Ignorance, Doubt, or Errour of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that can exempt him from the Duty of obeying.</hi> And if (however) <hi>it may insnare him in any certainty of sinning, whether he obey or disobey</hi> (which they irrationally affirm, unlike Scholars or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and less like Christians) yet <hi>to obey</hi> in that case, were the <hi>lesser evil.</hi> And <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, would be as true in this case, as in any other. So that our Rule remains good (for ought they have said, or can say to the contrary,) <hi>That if the Exemption from Obedience be not as evident, as the Command to Obey, it must needs be sin not to obey.</hi> What they add touching a <hi>Thing forbidden of God, and commanded of Man,</hi> is unexcusably impertinent to the Matter in hand. The
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104659:17"/> present subject of our Discourse being a Thing <hi>not forbidden by God or Man,</hi> but <hi>commanded rather by both.</hi> Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Man, and mediately by God, who commandeth Obedience to all such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                        <p>Again, They openly confess, (though they seem afterwards to be sorry for the necessity of that Confession) That if the Thing be really <hi>lawful,</hi> and so <hi>Obedience</hi> a <hi>Duty,</hi> then <hi>he who doubteth, or erreth, should (if possible) suddenly lay by his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or doubt, and so obey.</hi> Only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they add, (to make some room, a Loop-hole at least, for a liberty to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,) <hi>If that cannot be,</hi> (and such wants of Ability they are delighted to suppose,) <hi>he should go about the fittest means for his better Information, 'till he be resolved, and so obey.</hi> Whereas the contrary is clear, that having no <hi>Doubt</hi> at all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Word of God is True, when it earnestly commandeth him <hi>to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords sake;</hi> and having <hi>no Doubt</hi> at all whether it is lawful to do what God bids him in plainest terms. He is first bound to that which he is sure is his Duty; and his Refusal of which he is as sure to be his sin; and then to seek for Information, whether the Thing whereof he doubts, is indeed <hi>unlawful.</hi> For in that he does
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104659:17"/> but <hi>doubt</hi> it, it may be lawful for ought he knows; and hence it follows unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably, That unless a Prohibition is found in <hi>Scripture against</hi> the wearing of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, <hi>against</hi> the Sign of the Cross in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>against</hi> the Gesture of Kneeling at Receiving the Holy Sacrament, and that as <hi>evident</hi> as the Precepts for being obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto Governours; It is not any Man's <hi>saying,</hi> That such or such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Rite <hi>hath the face of Idolatry,</hi> (which he who says can never <hi>think</hi>) that can excuse him from sin in Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                        <p>So as the <hi>Rule</hi> is still firm in the first part of it, (because so firm in the second) <hi>That Rules and Canons for Decency, made, and urged by Superiours, must be obeyed by Inferiours, 'till it be made as clear, that now they are not bound to obey, as 'tis evident in general, that they ought to obey Superiours.</hi> And that we may not disobey the lawful Magistrate upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other account, than their commanding us to sin, is universally the Doctrine, as well of Ancient, as Modern Divines.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The Rejoinder.</head>
                        <p>Having hitherto been large in the main Particulars,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists fourth Rule defended.</note> we may well be the briefer in those that follow, especially in the fifth Paragraph, unto which their Reply is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly short. They <hi>confess</hi> our <hi>fourth Rule,</hi> (though they touch not the Reasons of it,) <hi>That neither pretence of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor real Error of Conscience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empteth from the Obligation to obey.</hi> But so partial they are to the <hi>darling sin,</hi> the sin of Disobedience to Publick Parents, as to affirm That the pretence or real Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Conscience <hi>may so ensnare, as that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104659:19"/> the obeying, of the Two, shall become the greater sin.</hi> Whereby they give us just occasion of returning four Things.</p>
                        <p>First, It implies a Contradiction <hi>for any Man's duty to be his sin:</hi> Much less can it be a <hi>more</hi> grievous sin, than his <hi>Refusal</hi> to do his Duty.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Nor can we imagine any such Case wherein a Man can be brought to a necessity of sinning, whether he obey, or not obey, what just Authority hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. Indeed of Evils <hi>not Moral,</hi> the <hi>least</hi> are to be chosen; but of two <hi>Moral Evils,</hi> no man ought to choose either. Which yet they pretend a sad necessity of Doing, and so encourage thereby their Disciples to do it. So strangely favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they are upon all Occasions, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may conduce to, a <hi>new Rebellion,</hi> that they are still seeking for Arguments to make it as <hi>lawful as they may;</hi> nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>needful</hi> too.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conscience</hi> (properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) cannot stand with such Errour, as they suppose. For <hi>Conscience</hi> signifying <hi>knowledge,</hi> must cease to be such if it be <hi>erroneous,</hi> and is indeed an <hi>erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> only. We cannot erre concerning that, whereof we have a full knowledge, and <hi>whilst</hi> we have it. So as by <hi>errour of Conscience</hi> is only meant Errour of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the Vulgar and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrestical
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104659:19"/> way of speaking. And if they mean any thing else, they must tell us <hi>what.</hi> But no <hi>such errour of Opinion</hi> can either <hi>abrogate a Law,</hi> or null that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by which 'tis made, or make the Matter of the Law become <hi>unlawful.</hi> And therefore let a man's <hi>doubting</hi> be what it will, as whether it is lawful to wear a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, or the like; yet being quite <hi>out of doubt,</hi> whether God hath commanded him to pay Obedience to his Superiours, 'tis clear he must follow his <hi>greater light;</hi> and so he cannot sin possibly in his wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Surplice on that account. For he prefers what <hi>he knows,</hi> to what he <hi>doubts of,</hi> and values his <hi>light</hi> above his <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> whereas that which the <hi>Dissenters</hi> desire to teach him, is to <hi>love darkness rather than light;</hi> rather to stick at a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> which God hath <hi>no where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> than to obey the lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, which God hath <hi>every where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi> Nor can a Man's <hi>doubting</hi> so much as <hi>excuse</hi> his not doing what he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104659:20"/> submit to the use of Things <hi>indifferent,</hi> are the very same Men who made <hi>no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World,</hi> to swallow <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Schism, Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> and (as Accessaries at least,) even <hi>Regicide it self;</hi> and that when Commanded by an <hi>Authority,</hi> (if They were at all <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>) the most <hi>unjust</hi> to be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <p>[Though Charity will move to pity, and relieve those that are truly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or scrupulous, yet we must not break God's Commands in Charity to them; and therefore we must not perform Publick Services undecently or disorderly, for the ease of Tender Consciences.]</p>

                        <p>O! That you would but do all that God alloweth you; yea, that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you for these ends! How happy would you make your selves, and these poor afflicted Churches! But as to the Instance of your Rule, we Answer,</p>
                        <p>First, When the Indecency and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is so small, as that it will not cross the ends, so much as our Disobedience would, we are here so far more conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and peaceable than you, as that we would even in God's Worship, do some things indecent and disorderly, rather than disobey; and so should you do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than destroy your Brethren, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104659:21"/> that Peace and Healing of the Church: For Order is for the thing ordered, and not contrarily. For Example, There is much disorder lyes in the Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book, yet we would obey in it, as far as the ends of our Calling do require. It would be undecent to come without a Band, or other handsom Raiment into the the Assembly; yet rather than worship God not at all, we would obey if That were Commanded us; we are as confident that Surplices and Copes are undecent, and kneeling at the Lord's Table is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, as you are of the contrary; and yet if the Magistrate would be advised by us, (supposing himself addicted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, we would advise him to be more charitable to you, than you here advise him to be to us: We would have him (if your Conscience require it,) to forbear you in this undecent, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way: But to speak more distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                        <p>First, There are some Things decent and orderly, when the opposite Species are not undecent or disorderly.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There are some Things unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and disorderly in a <hi>small</hi> and <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> degree; and some Things in a degree <hi>intolerable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:104659:21"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> When Things decent are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whose Opposites are not indecent at all, There, Charity, and Peace, and Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may command a <hi>Relaxation;</hi> or rather should at first, restrain from too Severe <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</hi> As it is Decent to wear either a Cloak, or a Gown, a Cassock Buttoned, or unbuttoned, with a Girdle, or without, to sit, stand or kneel, in Singing of a Psalm, to sit or stand, in hearing of the Word read or Preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, When a <hi>Circumstance</hi> is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or disorderly, but in a <hi>Tolerable</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to an Inconvenience, Obedience, or Charity, or Edification, may command us to do it, and make it not only Lawfull, but a Duty <hi>Pro hic &amp; Nunc,</hi> while the <hi>praeponderating</hi> Accident prevaileth. Christ's Instances go at least as far as this, about the Priests in the Temple breaking the <hi>Sabbath</hi> blamelessly; and <hi>David's</hi> Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Shew-bread, which was Lawfull for none to eat ordinarily, but The Priests: And the Disciples rubbing the Ears of Corn; <hi>(I will have Mercy &amp; not Sacrifice,)</hi> is a Lesson which befits us to learn; when Two Duties come together, to preferr the greater, if we would escape Sin: And sure, to keep an able Preacher in the Church, or a private Christian in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is a greater Duty, <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> than to use a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104659:22"/> to be Decent: It is more orderly to use the Better Translation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than the Worse, as the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book doth;</hi> and yet we would have no Man cast out, for using the Worse: It is more orderly, decent, and Edifying, for the Minister to read all the Psalms, than for the People to read each Second Verse; and yet we would not cast out Men from the Church, or Ministry Meerly for that Disorder; It is more orderly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to be uncovered in Divine Worship, than covered; and yet rather than a Man should take cold, we could allow him to hear a Sermon, or Chapter, covered: Why (not much more) rather than He should be cast out? But let us come to the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; It is no undecent disorderly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of God, to Worship him without our Cross, Surplice or Kneeling in the Reception of the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>First, If it were, then Christ, and his Apostles had Worshipt undecently and disorderly. And the Primitive Church, that used not the <hi>Surplice,</hi> nor the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient</hi> Image of the <hi>Cross,</hi> in Baptism (but in an <hi>Unguent</hi>) yea, the Church for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hundred Years, that received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament without <hi>Kneeling.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Then if the King, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Convocation should change <hi>These</hi> Ceremonies, it seems you would
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104659:22"/> take your selves Bound to retain them; for you say you must not Worship God <hi>Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently:</hi> But that they may be <hi>changed</hi> by Authority, our <hi>Articles</hi> determine, and Therefore Charity may well require the Magistrate to change them without any wrong to the Worship of God.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we appeal to the common Judgment, of the Impartial, whether in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the thing, there be any thing that tells them, that it is <hi>Undecent,</hi> to pray without a <hi>Surplice</hi> in the <hi>Reading</hi> Place, and not undecent to pray without in the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> And that it is undecent to Baptize without <hi>Crossing,</hi> and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord's Supper <hi>without: And that it is undecent for the Receiver to take the Lord's Supper</hi> without <hi>Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and not for the Minister to give it him standing that prayeth in the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

                           <hi>[We must not break God's Commands in Charity to Men, and therefore must not perform his Publick Service indecently, or disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the ease of tender Consciences.]</hi> Which Rule our Dissenters are so farr from refuting, or denying, that they choose rather to say, <hi>we walk not by it.</hi> But they say it after their manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the appearance of any <hi>proof;</hi> and as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104659:23"/>
                           <hi>proofless</hi> is that which follows, where they preferr their disobedience before the <hi>Deceny</hi> and <hi>order</hi> we observe; and as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring more of Charity, than the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> of their <hi>Superiors.</hi> But how far they are estranged from Christians Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they have demonstrated too plainly to need our help. And as by many others, so by this, their seventh Paragraph, wherein they say in broad Terms, (without respect to the <hi>praecept of fearing God and the King</hi>) that <hi>there is much disorderli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Common-Prayer Book; that our's is an indecent disorderly way.</hi> This (I say) shews their want, not of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> only, and <hi>Meekness,</hi> but of <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> also. For our Liturgy being known to have been established, in four or five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant <hi>Monarchs</hi> Reigns, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by many Acts of Parliament, as well as approved, and daily used by the most eminent in the Land, both for Knowledge, and Piety, and Peaceableness of Mind, It follows from that, it's <hi>defamers,</hi> do most punishably censure <hi>the Law it self,</hi> by which our Liturgy is establish't, and Spit in the face of that <hi>Authority,</hi> from which that Law receives it's force. And most unchristianaly condemn, as well the King, and the Nobility, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Doctours of the Church, with the most, as well as the best of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104659:23"/> Gentry, (who choose to serve God by our publick Liturgy) even for serving God so, as the Law enjoins. Perhaps not considering, how they fall under the Penalties of the known Laws inforced, which were they only let loose upon them, would send them presently to Jayl, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bail and Main prize, and keep them there for six Months; and make them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit to the King for their first offence in this kind a whole years profit of all their Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Promotions; which the more they do cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for want of Charity, the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they prove that themselves have none.</p>
                        <p>Secondly what they say of their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness [<hi>to advise the Magistrate</hi> (supposing he were addicted to them against us,) to <hi>forbear us in our indecent, and disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, if our consciences required it,</hi>] we wish we were as able, as willing to believe: But our many years suffering's under your several Persecutions, casting us out even by Thousands, for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Laws, Ecclesiastical and Civil, (in our Adherence to the Liturgy, which they and their Masters had voted down) have made us unable to believe what now they tell us in our Prosperity. They may remember how the Usurpers were Several times incens't against us; and by whom we were accused either as <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandrian</hi> or <hi>Grotian Papists.</hi> And what
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104659:24"/> was boasted by <hi>Mr. White</hi> (the meroiless Chair-man of the Committee set up for mischief to the Regular Clergy,) that they had sequestred little less than 8000 Ministers, in little more than four years; We may judge also by your <hi>Books against all manner of Toleration, and in defence of their Scotish Covenant,</hi> how little Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they would yield us, had they the Power they once usurped, who now do challenge so great a Liberty, to all that are of their way.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, They <hi>acknowledge the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of coming to Church without a Band, or any other handsom Rayment:</hi> And yet they say, <hi>they would obey,</hi> if <hi>that were commanded them, rather than not Worship God at all.</hi> Would they but use the like reasoning in other Instances and Cases, as well as in that, we might enjoy our Blessed <hi>Canaan,</hi> without a <hi>Canaanite</hi> to Infest or disturbe our Peace. And here we pray them to consider, (seeing some of their Party have professed they would reject from the holy Sacrament, such as should offer to receive it <hi>with their Hats upon their Heads,</hi> notwithstanding that by Law it is not particularly forbidden) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may not <hi>as well,</hi> (and with a great Deal <hi>more Reason,</hi>) reject such Persons from the Sacrament, as will not <hi>Kneel at</hi> the Receiving; We being particularly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104659:24"/> and by a Law still in force, to give it only to such as kneel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Their first supposition of things <hi>decent</hi> being Commanded, whose <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites</hi> would not be <hi>undecent,</hi> is either No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, and therefore signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing with us, or else 'tis but a <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> which shew's that <hi>they</hi> are of <hi>one</hi> mind, and all their <hi>Governors</hi> of <hi>another.</hi> And that they very much prefer their <hi>private</hi> Judgments unto the <hi>publick,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as by their first, so by their Second supposition. But by their favour, it is not a greater duty to <hi>keep an able Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Church</hi> (who imploys his ability in doing mischief to Church and State,) or <hi>a private Christian in communion</hi> (who despises Dominion, and speaks evil of Dignities) than to use a ceremony which we conceive to be <hi>decent,</hi> when confessed to be <hi>lawfull</hi> by the most rigid of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and also Commanded by that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which God commandeth us to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. Let our Dissenters shew us how they can neglect to use the Ceremony which is Commanded by <hi>Law and Canon,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disobedience to that <hi>Authority</hi> by which that <hi>Law and Canon</hi> is made, and they shall have our consent to their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</p>
                        <p>The next thing that follows, is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and receives it's Rejoinder from
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104659:25"/> what was said by us before. Very vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pititions of the same sense in other Colours we are content should be their peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Their <hi>Application</hi> (as they call it) is most ridiculous; and seems to imply their not <hi>considering</hi> (what they cannot but know) that many things may be <hi>decent,</hi> however some <hi>more</hi> than others, according to the place we live in. And <hi>which</hi> is most fit of several <hi>Decenies</hi> to be chosen, not the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> but their <hi>Governors</hi> are to determine. But being <hi>established by Law,</hi> Things are not <hi>decent</hi> only, but <hi>necessary;</hi> and that <hi>establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is the Thing we still consider, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (for ought we yet see) they still resolve to undervalue it. 'Tis true indeed, the Magistrate may <hi>change</hi> such Laws, when ever Charity shall require: But when 'tis Charity so to do, not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> must be the Judge.

                        <p>Sixtly, We do not say it is <hi>indecent</hi> to pray <hi>without</hi> a Surplice, but to pray <hi>with</hi> it we say is <hi>decent.</hi> And where Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Authority, we say 'tis <hi>more;</hi> even as <hi>necessary</hi> to do it, as to obey them <hi>who have the Rule over us.

                        <p>You have the thing you call for, and now may do with it what you please. I wish our separating Brethren, whom we do at once <hi>Love</hi> and are <hi>Angry</hi> with, (for so are Parents with their own Children, and even Husbands with their own Wives, upon like occasions,) were as much ours as we wish them; and as desirous of our Communion, as we are really of Theirs. I wish with all my heart, they had our <hi>prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> with our <hi>Minds;</hi> I wish they had our Conformity to the Laws we live under, (which are the Laws we live by too,) upon Condition that you and I might live by no other Bread, than what we beg at their Dores, or earn with our own Hand. For what sincere Lover of God, and of God's <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> of Prosperity also and Peace, throughout the whole Church, and State of <hi>England,</hi> would not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the <hi>Ʋniformity;</hi> and so the <hi>Ʋnity</hi>

I know that many of our Dissenters are men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Parts, as well natural, as acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; however, their Passions and Prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions do often move them to write and reason, exceedingly <hi>unlike,</hi> and <hi>below</hi> themselves. Alas their Mouths cannot be Stopt, nor their Pens stinted, nor their Inventions put to a Nonplus either by All we can say, or that can be said: But Time, and Experience, sad Meditation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, may happily make them to become <hi>their own Converts.</hi> Were I to help them for my life in so good a work, I would beseech them with Importunity, to weigh the <hi>Praeface</hi> to the First Sermon of the most learned, the most Judicious, and the most Humble Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> and in particular, that part of his 23th <hi>Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> I here subjoin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Reverend Arch-Bishop</hi> Whitgift, <hi>&amp; the Learned</hi> Hooker, <hi>Men of great</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>and</hi> famous <hi>in their Times, did long since</hi> foresee, <hi>and accordingly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their fear, that if ever</hi> Puritanism <hi>should prevail among us, it would soon draw in</hi> Anabaptism <hi>after it. [At this</hi> Cartwright, <hi>and other the Advocates for the</hi> Disciplination <hi>Interest in those daies, seemed to take</hi> great offence; <hi>as if those</hi> fears <hi>were rather,</hi> pretended <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104659:26"/> an</hi> Odium <hi>upon them, than that there was otherwise any</hi> just cause <hi>for the same; protesting ever their utter dislike of</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism, <hi>and how free they were from the least thoughts of introducing it. But this was only their own mistake; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jealousie: For those</hi> godly men <hi>were neither so unadvised, nor so uncharitable, as to become Judges of other Mens thoughts or Intentions, beyond what their Actions spoke them,] They only consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as</hi> Prudent men, that Anabaptism <hi>had it's</hi> rise, <hi>from the same</hi> Principles <hi>the</hi> Puritans <hi>held, and it's</hi> growth, <hi>from the same</hi> Courses <hi>they</hi> took, <hi>together with the natural tendency of those</hi> Principles <hi>and</hi> Practices <hi>thitherward; especially of that one</hi> Principle, <hi>as it was by them mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood, that the</hi> Scripture <hi>was</hi> adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quata agendorum regula, <hi>so as nothing might be</hi> lawfully done <hi>without some express</hi> warrant <hi>either from some</hi> Command, <hi>or</hi> Example <hi>therein contained.</hi> The clue <hi>whereof, if followed on as far as it would lead, would certainly in Time carry them as far as the</hi> Anabaptists <hi>were then gone. But if it was no</hi> vain fear, <hi>the unhappy</hi> event <hi>hath proved, and</hi> justified <hi>them: Since what they feared is now</hi> come to pass, <hi>and that in a very high degree. Yet did not they see the</hi> Thread drawn <hi>out to that</hi> length <hi>as we have seen it; (The

                  <p>IT must own to all the World 'twas your distinguishing kindness that did prevent my acquaintance with you; when my Circumstances made it no less my interest than my option to lye obscure. An ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary respect I must not esteem it, that you were pleased, to trace my foot-steps in my solitude, and when you had found me out by the forreign Character of <hi>Tile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that you never gave over the Inquest till you had gain'd my name and heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whereof you have therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly been the possessor ever since.</p>
                  <p>For this Reason I cannot deceive you; That I presented you with my <hi>Verdict</hi> was not meerly my Kindness, but the Justice of my Gratitude; And (to be true to you) it came along with something of design, which I have now obtained in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Debate</hi> was carried on till the <hi>Dissenters</hi> took the Confidence to make a large <hi>Reply</hi> (for it has ever been their Practice to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>They <hi>Cavil</hi> at every thing, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at things which they confess they do not understand; wherein I have some reason to believe them.</p>
                  <p>By this means they got the greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation (if wise and sober men will think it so) that they were able to make Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and had some grounds for it; though herein they were so unhappy many times, as to give advantage to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by so doing.</p>
                  <p>These are some of the <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> the Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Dissenters</hi> had taken that, which was thought no less their <hi>Advantage</hi> than their <hi>Confidence,</hi> I could never understand.</p>
                  <p>But I am sure, 'twas none of your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as the <hi>Reader</hi> must Conclude from <hi>this,</hi> which is but the least part of your performance towards a full Rejoinder.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps some of the Reverend Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners were of opinion, That the shortest way to answer them, was Contempt; and the only way to make them weary of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, was to treat them as we are wont to do a Scold, by letting her have the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the last word.</p>
                  <p>But alas! these are a sort of Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries so stiff and Confident, that as they are restless in buzzing about to make a Noise; so where they alight, they'l stick too fast to be blown off with a slight neglect; And your Silence though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a secret disdain of their trifling weakness, as a pious Artifice to charm them, shall make them so much the more insolent; as if you had given them a real Argument of your Conviction, that you were too impotent and feeble to hold up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104659:29"/> their boasts &amp; triumphs upon that account.</p>
                  <p>And whatsoever they thought Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Their weaker and deluded <hi>Party</hi> took it <hi>Pro Confesso,</hi> that every thing they said was true, and all their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unanswerable; because they found some Men were fal'n asleep, and they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served so little to care to answer them.</p>
                  <p>This they frequently Suggested to their Party; and it begat a Prejudice in the weak, and a high conceit in the minds of the Schismatical. It <hi>hardned</hi> some, and <hi>Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar'd</hi> others. Men began to reflect upon the Case, and thought 'twas not a little unconscionable to <hi>impose</hi> Those things, which, now they had some colour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, could not be justified.</p>
                  <p>This lessened the reputation as well of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party, as of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> it self, among Such as were but <hi>cold</hi> in their affection, and had but an <hi>indifferent</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them before.</p>
                  <p>Some were glad of this occasion to turn <hi>Advocates</hi> to solicite for a general <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and others were no less forward to shew their <hi>good will</hi> to gratifie the <hi>Party</hi> by their inclination, to strip the Church, not only of the <hi>Ornamental</hi> part of her establishment, but also of some eminent branches of Gods <hi>External</hi> Worship; And seem'd glad to bring these Dissenters in to Communion with the Church upon any
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104659:29"/> terms; to fortifie her interest, as they imagined, against the Common Enemy: Which (as an excellent person hath very well observed) <hi>was no better policy, than for a man that is assaulted by a Lyon, to let loose a Bear for his assistance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Dissenting</hi> Party, thinking they had now gotten the better end of the Staff, began to grow the more daring (as it ever happens in Popular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions) and thought they might very safely attempt to set up for themselves, &amp; be allowed to share in the <hi>Government,</hi> if not to give <hi>Laws</hi> to their Governors. And some were so bold as to declare, There <hi>was no</hi> other way to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This awakened all wise and sober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who presently discerned, That, what had been so gently Condescended to for quietness sake, amounted to no less (upon the matter) than what <hi>Herodias</hi> had obtained by her dancing before <hi>Herod,</hi> even to the one half of the Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>These men doubtless are of a very strange Complexion. Their Conscience they can stretch to such a <hi>Latitude,</hi> as to reconcile and take in Contradictions.

                     <p>Would not any sober man be apt to conclude from this bold assertion, 1.

                     <p>But I must remember, my Promise; to give some instance of their <hi>Cavilling,</hi> wherein they betray their temper, and give advantage to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> In the Prayer before the <hi>Consecration</hi> at the Celebration of the Lord's <hi>Supper,</hi> The Church very devoutly Supplicates after this manner, That <hi>our sinful Bodies may be made clean by his Body, and our Souls washed through his most pretious Blood.</hi> At this, those <hi>Dissenters</hi> took exception, and express their frivolous <hi>Cavil</hi> in these words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We desire, that whereas these words seem to give a greater efficacy, to the Blood then to the Body of Christ,</hi> they may be altered thus; <hi>That our Sinful Souls and Bodies may be cleansed through his pretious Body and Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this is but a <hi>Cavil,</hi> is evinced out of their very exception; for they could only say these words <hi>seem</hi> to give a <hi>greater efficacy</hi> to the <hi>Blood</hi> then to the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ; And this their <hi>scruple</hi> or <hi>Cavil</hi> rather, is quite taken off at the <hi>distribution</hi> of the <hi>Sacramental Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> where it is clear that no less is <hi>(generally)</hi> attributed to the <hi>Body</hi> then to the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ; for at the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Bread</hi> the Priest says; <hi>The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104659:36"/> for thee, preserve thy Body and Soul unto everlasting Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the same expression is used at the delivery of the Cup: <hi>The Blood of our Sord Jesus Christ, which was shed for thee, preserve thy Body and Soul unto everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</hi> Where we see the very same <hi>effect</hi> (generally) is attributed as well to the <hi>Body,</hi> as to the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ. And yet this could not satisfie their <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulosity;</hi> for they <hi>cavil</hi> at it; and desire that <hi>at the Distribution of the Bread and Wine to the Communicants, they may use the words of our Saviour as neer as may be.</hi> I thought they might have objected, that these expressions seem to give a greater efficacy to the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, then to all the Passions and Merits of his <hi>Soul,</hi> and the infinite excellencies of his <hi>Divinity;</hi> but their minds were blinded in that fit of Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and so this came not into their Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                     <p>And yet herein they gratifie the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For if there be not a <hi>distinct</hi> effect of Christ's Body and Blood, what need a <hi>distinct</hi> Element to represent and <hi>convey</hi> the benefits; for <hi>frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora.</hi> In the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Priest consecrates
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104659:37"/> in <hi>both</hi> kinds, to represent the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ in the Separation of his <hi>Soul</hi> from his <hi>Body.</hi> And if the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ have not their <hi>distinct Operations</hi> &amp; <hi>efficacy,</hi> why should any man quarrel at the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for their Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy and Administring the Sacrament but in one kind; for what can they say to this Doctrine of that Church (according to their <hi>Hypothesis</hi>) that <hi>in regard Christ</hi> is truely <hi>present</hi> in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> (which floweth from thence) is not inherent in the <hi>Elements,</hi> which affect the Senses, but in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of <hi>Christs Flesh,</hi> which through the <hi>Divinity</hi> united to it, not only has Life in it self, but comfers it upon the worthy <hi>Receiver.</hi> Such therefore as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a <hi>Real Presence,</hi> ought not to scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at the receiving of the Eucharist in <hi>one</hi> kind, seeing they receive (therein) all that the nature and virtue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament contains, and are the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they receive it <hi>fully,</hi> because in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, are not <hi>really</hi> but only <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> divided, and Consequently it is manifest, <hi>He</hi> is <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>entirely</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who <hi>alone</hi> is able to satisfie the Soul.</p>

To the first of these Allegations, That the Priest, not only in the act of <hi>Consecration,</hi> but also in his personal <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> of the Elements <hi>distinctly,</hi> that is, the Bread <hi>apart</hi> and the Cup <hi>apart,</hi> doth sufficiently represent the <hi>separation</hi> of Christs <hi>Blood</hi> from his <hi>Body,</hi> and so fully represent his <hi>Death;</hi> And the people joyn with him in the <hi>Commemoration</hi> thereof, as is required, though they are not partakers of the <hi>Cup.</hi> And to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, they will say, that though the <hi>Appetites</hi> of the Soul have some <hi>Analogy</hi> with those of the <hi>Body,</hi> yet being <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the object must be so too, and Consequently the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ received by <hi>Concomitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> will <hi>satisfie</hi> as well the <hi>thirst</hi> as the <hi>hunger</hi> of the devout Soul: And they will say further, that in the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> are but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Appetite, and therefore may very well be satisfied, with Christ, if they believe, <hi>His Real Presence,</hi> under one <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical</hi> representation; as the <hi>Jews</hi> were in eating their <hi>Phascal Lamb,</hi> though they were not allowed to eat the <hi>Blood</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore to justifie the Prayer and Practice of the Church in this particular, we shall discourse otherwise and consider,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104659:38"/> That the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> as designed to be a <hi>Channel</hi> of Grace to <hi>wash</hi> and <hi>Cleanse</hi> and <hi>sanctifie</hi> the whole man, so it <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> only in virtue of Christs <hi>institution;</hi> and conveighs no more than what it is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> to represent. Now it is evident from the words of <hi>Consecration,</hi> what <hi>efficacy</hi> our blessed Saviour was pleased to ascribe to the <hi>respective</hi> Elements: <hi>This is my Body</hi> which is given for you; And, <hi>this is the new Testament in my Blood,</hi> or the <hi>Blood of the new Covenant.</hi> The Body and Blood of Christ are not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Conjunction in either</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Lucas Brugensis</hi> confesseth that the bread is <hi>figura Corporis Christi exsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>à sanguine seperati,</hi> The figure of Christs Body <hi>Bloodless,</hi> or <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Blood.</hi> And the Apostle is very clear in the case, 1 Cor. 10.16. <hi>The Cup of blessing which we bless is it not the Communion of the Bloud of Christ?

                     <p>And having laid down this in general, then he comes to deliver himself distinctly to our purpose in these words: <hi>Caro enim Salvatoris pro Salute Corporis, Sanguis verò pro Animá nostrâ effusus est:</hi> that is, The Flesh of our Saviour, was given for the Salvation of the Body, but his Blood was shed for the Soul.</p>

                     <p>And this he finds prefigured in <hi>Moses's</hi> Laws, where we may observe, that when they offer'd Sacrifice, something was to be done with the <hi>Body, and</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Sacrifice; and a very strict Injunction was given for this <hi>distinct</hi> disposal of <hi>them,</hi> as is to be seen <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.7, 18, 25, 30, 34.

                     <p>The <hi>Body</hi> of the Sacrifice was to be <hi>burnt</hi> to make an expiation for the Body (<hi>Levit.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12.) but the <hi>Blood</hi> was to be disposed of otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> at the <hi>bottom,</hi> or upon the <hi>horns</hi> of the Altar, <hi>to make an Atonement for the Soul.</hi> This is set down expresly with the reason of it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. <hi>For the life of the Flesh is in the Blood; and I have given it to you upon the Altar to make an Atonement for the Soul; for it is the Blood that maketh an Atonement for the Soul.</hi>

                        <hi>Si igitur apud Veteres imago fuit Veritatis, saith</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> if therefore there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Antient Jews the Image of that Truth, which now appears and is made manifest in the coming of our Saviour: How can the <hi>Hereticks</hi> suppose the <hi>Old Testament</hi> to be contrary to the <hi>new,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they give a mutual Testimony to one another?</p>

                     <p>And this will be sufficient to return to the vain <hi>Cavil</hi> of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> in this point; and to justifie the Practice of the Church in praying at the Celebration of the Lords Supper, <hi>That our sinful Bodies may be made clean by his Body, and our Souls washed through his most pretious Blood.</hi>

                        <p>THey plead, That some things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon their Faith, tendered to subscription, as Articles of Faith, which are either false, or at best, they have not yet been so happy as to discover the truth of them.

                     <item>They plead, That they are not satisfied in the use of any <hi>Mystical Ceremonies</hi> in God's Worship; and particularly they judge <hi>the use of the Cross</hi> in Baptism to be sinful. A Sacrament of <hi>Divine</hi> Institution, according to the definition of the Church in her <hi>Catechism,</hi> is <hi>an outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible Grace, given to us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a Pledge to assure us thereof.</hi> Where we have, <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Matter</hi> of a Sacrament, <hi>An out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:104659:49"/> and visible sign of an inward and Spiritual Grace. 2.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sacrament, <hi>Christ himself. 3.</hi> The <hi>End</hi> of it, to be a <hi>means</hi> to convey the thing signified, and a <hi>Pledge</hi> to assure us of it. Hence it's evident, that it's simply impossible that any Church should institute a Divine Sacrament; because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give it a Causality to those Graces it is instituted to signifie. Nevertheless it's possible for Men to institute Humane Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; which shall have the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Sacrament, that is, <hi>An outward visible sign of an inward Spiritual Grace;</hi> and they may pretend to ascribe an <hi>Effect</hi> to it also, <hi>To stir up, to excite or increase Grace and Devotion:</hi> And yet because it wants the Right Efficient Cause, it's no <hi>lawful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> though it be an <hi>humane Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Such an Institution <hi>(say they)</hi> is <hi>the Sign of the Cross. An outward visible sign of an inward Spiritual Grace, ordained by Men as a means to effect whatever Man can work by his Ordinance.</hi> Here is the matter without Divine Signature, which is the thing they condemn it for. <hi>p. 49</hi>

                     <item>They plead, That since <hi>Communion</hi> with the Church is suspended and denied, but upon such terms as take away Christian
<pb facs="tcp:104659:50"/> Liberty in part, and by consequence leave all the rest at Mercy; they dare not accept of Communion upon those Terms. There are some things, which in the General, God has left free and indifferent, to do or not do; yet at some times, and in some Cases it may be my great sin if I should do some of them; as when it would wound the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and destroy the Soul of a weak Christian. If now I shall engage my self to the Church, That I will never omit such <hi>an Indifferent thing;</hi> and the Soul of that weak Christian should call to me to omit it, I have tied my hands by Engagements, I cannot help him, though it would save his or a Thousand Souls out of Hell, because I have given away my freedom to the Church. <hi>p. 60</hi>

                     <item>They plead, That they ought not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their Souls in one Congregation, if they may more hopefully secure them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; for that their Souls are their greatest concernment in this World, and the next. Now, <hi>say they,</hi> there's no question but Men preach such as they print with Publick Allowance; and therefore they ought to provide better for their Souls elsewhere. Especially they say, That the Doctrine of Justification, is <hi>Articulus stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
<pb facs="tcp:104659:50"/> vel cadentis Ecclesiae,</hi> an Article with which the Church falls or stands. This Article, <hi>say they,</hi> in the Parish where we live, is quite demolish'd by the Doctrine of <hi>Justification by Works:</hi> We are bound therefore to provide for our safety and depart; and when We are once out, We will advise upon another Church, not which is tolerable, but which is most eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and in all things nearest the <hi>Word. p. 161</hi>

                     <label>Sect. 5.</label>
                     <item>They plead, That there's no Obligation upon them to own the <hi>Churches</hi> Power to impose new Terms of Communion, unless the Church can prove her Power from Christ. It's not for them to disprove it; it lies upon her to prove it, and to prove it substantially too, or else it will be hard to prove it their duty to own it. <hi>p. 181</hi>

                     <item>They say, The World is pestered with Disputes about <hi>Worship,</hi> about <hi>Religion;</hi> and therefore since All cannot be in the right, they are willing to go the safest Way, and worship God according to his Word: If the things disputed be lawful to be done, let them be so; they are sure it is
<pb facs="tcp:104659:51"/> lawful to let them alone. And they think there's no great hazard in keeping to <hi>Scripture Rule;</hi> nor can believe that Christ will send any to Hell, because they did not worship God in an external Mode, more neat and spruce than God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>p. 190</hi>

                     <label>Sect. 8.</label>
                     <item>They do not find, that God ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the things imposed, either in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in Special, or their Singulars: If God has commanded a duty to be done, the Church must find a place to do it in. But though the Church must find a place for the Duty, a time for the Duty, she may not find <hi>new Duty</hi> for the Time and Place. <hi>p. 216</hi>

                           <p>There is no Protestant Church of any creditable denomination, more moderate and ingenious in this point then ours is.

                           <p>The Scripture tells us, That <hi>Christ tasted death for every man,</hi> (Hebr. 2.9.) <hi>for Children.

                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis our Saviour's comfortable assertion, with a gracious invitation thereupon (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14.) <hi>Suffer little Children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> If these <hi>Dissenters</hi> be of a Cross-opinion, That of <hi>such</hi> is the Kingdom of <hi>Satan;</hi> They should in modesty keep their faith to themselves, till they can find a better proof than the <hi>Post-poning</hi> of <hi>Esau,</hi> whose person notwithstanding Learned Men do think was saved. In the Discourses of our Saviour, <hi>little children</hi> are <hi>Candidates</hi> for Heaven, and set forth as a <hi>pattern</hi> to such as shall undoubtedly inherit it, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3.) and he tells his Disciples, (<hi>v.</hi> 14.) <hi>It is not the will of your Father which is in Heaven, that one of these little ones should perish;</hi> which in all Reason must be understood of <hi>little</hi> Children <hi>literally,</hi> according to the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the words.</p>

                              <q>The Sacraments are not naked signs, but they do exhibit Grace; yet so, that this Grace is not wrought in the Minds of men <hi>ex opere operato Sacramentorum,</hi> but through the Ordinance and Operation of God alone, who in the right use of Sacraments, does always perform, that which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</q>

                           <p n="1">1. As it is a part of God's Worship, <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere Orationis,</hi> under the <hi>Genus</hi> of Prayer, so it procures Grace, <hi>ex opere Operantis, Per modum impetrationis,</hi> by way of <hi>impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                           <p>But here <hi>two</hi> Rules are very useful and necessary to be observed:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That in the <hi>operation</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as in all other of God's Ordinances) <hi>The excellency of the Power is of God and not of us.</hi> (2 Cor. 4.7.) and who can deny the effect when we have God's <hi>fiat</hi> for it? when he said, <hi>Let there be light, there was light;</hi> So it was at the Creation of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> light; and so it is at the Creation of <hi>internal</hi> light, when God is pleased to put forth his Power to that effect. (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) And methinks, Those men should easily be satisfied about the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are of <hi>opinion,</hi> that we are merely <hi>passive</hi> in the work of our Regeneration; that it is wrought <hi>in nobis sine nobis,</hi> wrought in us, (but) without us, and that irresistibly.</p>
                           <p>The Second <hi>Rule</hi> is,<note place="margin">

                           <p>What he means by a <hi>Divine Signature,</hi> is a matter of some question: if some <hi>institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>promise</hi> to annex <hi>Grace</hi> to it, we understand it not; But if he understands by <hi>Signature,</hi> some <hi>impression,</hi> that discovers something of God's <hi>Attributes,</hi> we say with the great Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18. with 24.</note> That the <hi>Preaching of the Cross</hi> sets forth <hi>the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God.</hi> There is this <hi>Divine Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature</hi> upon all Creatures: For <hi>the invisible things of God from the Creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,</hi> (Rom. 1.20.) <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God; (Psal.</hi> 19.)

                           </p>
                           <p>For a Sacrament <hi>properly</hi> so called, that is a <hi>Divine Sacrament</hi> (in the sense of the Church), That is a thing of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. For,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It must have <hi>Christ</hi> for its Author; all Ordinances of <hi>Divine</hi> Worship design'd to exhibit, to seal and convey <hi>supernatural</hi> Grace are of his Institution; because <hi>Eorum tantum est signum instituere, qui jus habent promittendi signatum, &amp; potentiam appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi;</hi>
                              <q>He only has power to appoint the sign who has right to promise, and power to apply the thing signified.</q> In this we are agreed.</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <pb n="61" facs="tcp:104659:84"/>2. As we are agreed in the Author, so in the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Sacrament; <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est sacrae rei signum,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin.</hi> A Sacrament is the sign of a thing Sacred; yet not every such sign (for then we should multiply Sacraments beyond reason) but such a Sacred thing as <hi>sanctifies</hi> the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; <hi>Sacramentum propriè est signum rei sacrae in quantum est sanctificans;</hi> Properly a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is the sign of a thing Sacred, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is ordain'd to Sanctifie.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. We are agreed in the <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>end;</hi> that God by the Mediation of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, gives his Grace to such as are <hi>worthily</hi> prepared for them, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. We are, I hope, agreed too, as to the <hi>Constituents</hi> of a Sacrament. To the making of a Sacrament, the <hi>word</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Consecration,</hi> the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative word, (<hi>Sermo operatorius,</hi> as St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> calls it,) <hi>Accedit verbum ad elementum &amp; fit Sacramentum;</hi> the word apply'd to the Element does make a Sacrament, saith St. <hi>Austin.</hi> We acknowledge, saith <hi>Zanchy,</hi> that a Sacrament is a <hi>visible</hi> sign: But of what? of an <hi>invisible</hi> Grace. But whence has it this <hi>(habitude)</hi> to be a sign of such a thing?<note place="margin">De Relig. Christ. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. p. 253. f.</note> from the <hi>word</hi> of Christ's insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, saith <hi>Zanchy.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From hence 'tis evident, that the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> is far from the Nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104659:85"/> in the <hi>proper</hi> Notion of the Church. For,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It has no <hi>office</hi> of <hi>Consecration</hi> to hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, no <hi>word</hi> of Prayer or <hi>Benediction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd upon it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It has not <hi>Christ</hi> for its <hi>Author;</hi> we do not find, we do not say He gave it <hi>institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to that effect.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. It has no internal <hi>sanctifying</hi> Grace for its Matter. And from hence it will unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably follow,</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That it does not <hi>confer, convey,</hi> or <hi>exhibit</hi> Grace, as the <hi>end</hi> of its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p>It is the Resolution of <hi>Fran. Hallier</hi>
                              <note n="*" place="margin">Defens. Eccles. Hierarch. c. 2. Sect. 3. Pag. 85.</note> (a sober and learned <hi>Sorbonist) Nullum signum practicum gratiae habitualis, ex opere operato eam Conferens, instituere potuit Ecclesia:</hi>
                              <q>The Church cannot institute any practical sign of habitual Grace, that can confer, that Grace, <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> because it is in the Power of God <hi>alone</hi> to confer habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace upon us: Nor can the Church of God appoint any sign to confer <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> helps and motions of Grace, <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> because Actual Grace is no less supernatural than habitual, and God is equally the Author and Dispensor of them both. And secondly, saith He, we cannot understand how any spiritual or supernatural effect should follow upon the putting of any sign, unless we have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104659:85"/> some Covenant or Divine Promise to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us, that such essect is annext to such a sign: but (saith he) we have no Testimony either of Scriptures, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, or Fathers, to assure us of any such Promise.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>And for the <hi>sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism (wherein we are now particularly concern'd) it has no peculiar reference to <hi>God,</hi> or the sacred <hi>Rite</hi> of Baptism: but to the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> into which we receive the baptized, and to the <hi>duty</hi> as to the <hi>end,</hi> unto which <hi>he</hi> is consigned; that <hi>he should not be ashamed to confess,</hi> &amp;c. This therefore is appointed to assert our <hi>Privilege,</hi> and the <hi>duty</hi> incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon that account. So that in the <hi>use</hi> of this <hi>Ceremony,</hi> there is no <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> presumed, no <hi>Consecration</hi> perform'd, no <hi>Promise</hi> pretended, no <hi>Grace</hi> expected among us. We cannot therefore be supposed to use it as a <hi>Suppletory</hi> Sacrament; Nor (tho' of very great <hi>Antiquity</hi>) was it ever design'd to <hi>add</hi> any the least <hi>Melioration, Virtue,</hi> or <hi>Efficacy,</hi> to our Holy Baptism: but used as a Collateral Appendage and <hi>Contesseration</hi> of our solemn Engagement: to notifie our <hi>Relation</hi> to a Crucified Redeemer: to assert our <hi>interest</hi> in the Merits of his Death and Passion: to put us in <hi>mind</hi> of our Christian Profession, and to <hi>excite</hi> us unto our Duty. After this <hi>account,</hi> if the <hi>Offence</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> be not yet ceased, I shall add these fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104659:86"/> Considerations for the Reader's satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. These <hi>Dissenters</hi> make use of these words, <hi>Humane Sacraments, Symbolical Rites, Mystical Ceremonies,</hi> out of design to make a noise, to amuse and affright the <hi>scrupulous</hi> and common Reader. The word <hi>Sacrament</hi> is of a very large signification; An <hi>Oath</hi> is call'd a Sacrament; so is the <hi>Creed</hi> by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
                              <note n="*" place="margin">So is the Paschal Feast. Epist 119.</note>, and the whole <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> by <hi>Tertullian;</hi> In the <hi>vulgar Latin, Marriage,</hi> is a Sacrament, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32. so is the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Christ (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.) <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s Dream. (<hi>Dan.</hi> 2.18, 30, 47.) The seven <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Candlesticks</hi> (Revel. 1.20.) The use of that word therefore (whatever these <hi>Dissenters</hi> make of it) is no matter of offence or objection in this case.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. We may make a <hi>sanctified use</hi> of all <hi>Creatures,</hi> of all <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> and of all emergent <hi>Accidents:</hi> This cannot in Reason be denyed; for by this holy usage of them, we turn them into a <hi>Ladder;</hi> and by them our minds ascend up to God. And such <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>visible</hi> signs have an aptitude to that effect. <hi>Signum est quod praeter speciem, quam ingerit sensibus, facit aliquid aliud in Cognitionem</hi> (alias <hi>Cogitationem) venire,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin.</hi> A sign is that which brings some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else into our thoughts and knowledge,<note place="margin">V. Labat de Sacram. p. 5. &amp; 6.</note> besides that which it offers to our senses. And such signs, whether they be <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
                              <pb n="65" facs="tcp:104659:86"/> if the things suggested by them or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from them, be <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> it makes no matter of consequence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be called <hi>Mystical Ceremonies, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Rites,</hi> or <hi>Humane Sacraments;</hi> For they are really nothing else but <hi>outward and visible things</hi> applied to a <hi>spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> use.</p>
                           <p>That <hi>such signs,</hi> or <hi>Humane Sacraments</hi> or <hi>Mystical Ceremonies</hi> (call them what you will) are, not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>laudable</hi> and of good use, is easie to evince. What if the sight of a <hi>Dial,</hi> puts me in mind, that my life is <hi>as a shaddow that departeth?</hi> and if I make the like reflection upon the striking of the <hi>Clock;</hi> and thereupon break out into this Ejaculation: <hi>[So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto Wisdom]</hi> What sober Christian could blame me for it? He was not an ill Man, who took occasion from the <hi>Feast</hi> at which he was entertain'd, to cry out, <hi>Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God;</hi> And our Saviour took occasion from thence to discourse of his great Gospel <hi>Supper.</hi> There may be much <hi>Divinity,</hi> and much <hi>Moral Duty,</hi> taught by <hi>Hieroglyphicks;</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion taught the <hi>Ninevites</hi> to put on <hi>Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath,</hi> to publish their sorrow and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5. to the 10th.</p>

                        <p>THey Plead, That since Communion with the Church is suspended and denyed, but upon such Terms as take away Christian Liberty in part, and by Consequence leaves all the rest at Mercy; They dare not accept of Communion upon those Terms. There are some things, which God has, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, left free and indifferent, to do or not

                           <p>Tho' the Church does <hi>restrain</hi> our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>part,</hi> yet the <hi>whole</hi> is not in danger; because she does declare, That where there is no Sin in the <hi>imposition,</hi> of things <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> (as to the <hi>nature</hi> of the things) yet Authority may be <hi>excessive,</hi> as to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity and number of them.

                           <p>The mean while we acknowledge that Christ hath purchased a <hi>Liberty</hi> for His Church: <hi>If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed, Joh.</hi> 8.36.</p>
                           <p>This is Liberty from a <hi>yoak of bondage:</hi> A yoak that had a heavy <hi>burden</hi> annext to it; From the bondage of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Ʋncleanness,</hi> with all the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Vanities,</hi> wherewith He had inthrall'd the wicked world; from the <hi>Captivity</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of Sin in our Members; from the <hi>Curse</hi> of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, and from the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, the <hi>fear</hi> of Death, and the <hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>Corruption</hi> upon that account; From the <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, with such Humane <hi>Traditions</hi> as had taken their rise from thence; And altho by <hi>Analogy</hi> some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are wont to reduce unto this Head such <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as become matter of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> in their use, or <hi>burdensom</hi> for their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and number; yet this does not impeach the Authority of the Church, in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such as shall be deemed meet to <hi>adorn</hi> the Solemnity, and procure Reverence and Devotion, in God's House and Worship.

But the Church did not make it self, nor its own Government: but Christ, who is Prince and Head, did first appoint Rules and Orders, constitute Laws and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, by which his Church should be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, and then did call and assemble it; and wherein he hath determin'd any thing, we are obliged to look upon it as necessary to the support and well-ordering of that Society.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104659:92"/> that is, not only to make them <hi>Prudent,</hi> but <hi>Infallible.</hi> Hereupon they did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that they had the <hi>mind</hi> of Christ, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.12.) but that they acted all <hi>in his Name</hi>

                           <p>Nor is this all, He asserts his Authority at a higher rate than this: He tells them <hi>he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104659:96"/> has</hi> [Power enough] <hi>in a readiness to avenge all disobedience,</hi> and to encounter such as were <hi>puffed</hi> up against his Clemency; which makes him put it to their Deliberation what <hi>Method</hi> of Discipline He should use among them: <hi>What will you? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, or in the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> (1 Cor. 4. last.) And if they will urge him to it, if he must <hi>use</hi> the Rod, He tells them he <hi>will not spare,</hi> He will <hi>use sharpness according to the Power the Lord had given him, to Edification, and not unto Destruction,</hi> (2 Cor. 13.10.) By excusing himself from this severity, He makes his threatning the more <hi>formidable,</hi> (saith <hi>Oecumenius</hi>) The <hi>Power</hi> of inflicting Censures, he ascribes to Christ; and tho' this Power may by <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> be destructive to the Flesh, yet it is certainly design'd for the benefit of the Church; <hi>Nam punire peccantes aedisicatio Ecclesiae est,</hi> the Punishment of Offenders, is the Edification of the Church, while by the Punishment of such, others are rendred more stedfast and more <hi>approved,</hi> says the same Author,<note place="margin">V. 2 Thes. 3.65.14.</note> when he made any <hi>Ordinances,</hi> he did expect a due observation of them; <hi>Now, I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Traditions</hi> (or the <hi>Ordinances) as I delivered them unto you.</hi> (1 Cor. 11.2<note n="*" place="margin">V. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> 1 ad Cor. 11.2.</note>.) And 'tis observed, These <hi>Traditions</hi> were not <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> but <hi>Ritual,</hi> and about things <hi>indifferent;</hi> nor yet were

But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</hi> The Apostle does here anticipate the prejudice of proud men, (saith <hi>Sclater</hi>) who had it in their hearts to object thus; <hi>Seeing we are spiritual, we are able enough surely to judge of these things; so that you shall not need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose your opinion.</hi> There were a sort of high-minded men, who thought themselves above the Apostles teaching; and the only Wise men of all the Church, and therefore they prefer'd themseves above all others; and here the Apostle does repress their <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious arrogance</hi> (saith <hi>Aretius.) Dickson</hi> calls them <hi>Sciolists</hi> (for all their pretended <hi>Gifts,</hi>) and tells us the Apostle does here <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn</hi> their <hi>affected ignorance,</hi> and a Precept being now given to the Governours of the Church, that they should acknowledge these Commands to be Divine, He remits these <hi>ignorant Contemners</hi> of them, to the <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators of Discipline</hi> (that's the <hi>Phrase</hi> it seems
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104659:97"/> among the <hi>Scotish Presbyterians</hi>) to be dealt withal according to the Rule and Judgment of the Apostle. In settling these <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> the Apostle seems to say, <hi>I have done my duty; if any man will yet continue obstinate, and will not understand his own,</hi> Let him affect his ignorance at his own peril; <hi>Nam spreta Authoritas Apostolica, Deum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet vindicem,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius;</hi> for when the Apostolical Authority is despised, God is the avenger of it. <hi>At{que} ita contentiosis qui ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescere nesciunt, &amp; nullum finem disputandi faciunt, fraenum injicit</hi> (saith <hi>Calixtus:</hi>) <q>And thus he casts a Bridle upon the Contentious, who know not how to acquiesce, or make an end of their disputing.</q> By all this it is evident, That the Apostle never set up any Christian Liberty against a just Authority; never intended to subject Authority to the designs of <hi>false Apostles</hi> or <hi>Pretenders</hi> to the Spirit; what he hath delivered in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>weak Christians</hi> we shall consider anon.</p>

                           <p>Here is a restraint put upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in favour of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and they restrain'd them in one practice which was amongst them, as a <hi>Foederal Rite</hi> of their Religion, <hi>eating in their Idols Temples, and of such meats as had been offer'd unto Idols;</hi> These things of themselves were <hi>indifferent,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10, 25, 27.

                           <p>Here was nothing determin'd as to the Point of <hi>Circumcision;</hi> yet in this very <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> it was tacitly imply'd, That after the Death of Christ, neither <hi>Circumcision,</hi> nor
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104659:101"/> the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Law, were <hi>necessary</hi> either to the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>obtaining</hi> of Faith or Salvation. And yet to <hi>such Jews</hi> as became <hi>Christians,</hi> and lived in <hi>Palestine,</hi> they concluded the observation thereof <hi>so far forth</hi> necessary, till the <hi>Destruction of the Temple,</hi> that they might not seem to have lost their <hi>reverence</hi> for God's Commands, and by that means so <hi>alienate</hi> the minds of their Countreymen both from themselves, and from Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
                           <p>To decide the Case concerning the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law,</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> does distinguish <hi>three</hi> Periods of Times. The <hi>first,</hi> before Christ's <hi>Passion,</hi> wherein those Precepts were <hi>alive,</hi> in <hi>vigour</hi> and of great <hi>obligation.</hi> The <hi>second</hi> time was from the <hi>passion</hi> of Christ to the <hi>sufficient Promulgation</hi> of the Gospel, wherein those Precepts were <hi>dead,</hi> and did neither <hi>bind</hi> nor <hi>profit</hi> any body, yet they were not <hi>deadly:</hi> but <hi>tolerated</hi> and <hi>exposed</hi> to <hi>view</hi> as a <hi>Herse</hi> lay'd in <hi>state,</hi> till they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an <hi>honourable Burial,</hi> in the <hi>rubbish</hi> of the Temple. But when men began to pay an <hi>awful Reverence</hi> to this deceased <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and to put their <hi>trust</hi> in it for <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation;</hi> then the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of this Law became <hi>deadly,</hi> and began to stink, as false <hi>signs</hi> of a thing <hi>to come,</hi> which really was already <hi>past;</hi> and then <hi>this</hi> Law was utterly <hi>exploded</hi> as an <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi>
                              <pb n="95" facs="tcp:104659:101"/> and an object of <hi>Superstition.</hi> To this observation of <hi>times</hi> by the Apostles, I shall add but one thing more: There was a <hi>time</hi> when the Apostle thought fit to tell the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that in <hi>some Cases,</hi> they might (then) expect a clearer <hi>Revelation, Phil.</hi> 3.15. But we being so well <hi>assured,</hi> that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture is <hi>Consigned</hi> to the Church, He will be in great danger of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> who now expects a <hi>further</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. As the Apostles did observe <hi>times,</hi> so they did determine <hi>things.</hi> What things were determined by that <hi>Council,</hi> (Act. 15.) (for a <hi>temporary</hi> observation among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>) you have seen already: But the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal question,</hi> that about <hi>Circumcision,</hi> was left undecided. At this the <hi>false Apostles</hi> and <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Pharisees</hi> took advantage. That <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be admitted into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion they did not deny, but would have <hi>Them</hi> made <hi>Proselytes</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Circumcision</hi> was the <hi>foederal Rite:</hi> This Sacrament therefore they must receive for their <hi>initiation,</hi> else they could not be saved▪ (as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.15.) This makes the Apostle write so sharply against <hi>Circumcision</hi> (which in effect did imply an <hi>obligation</hi> to observe the <hi>whole</hi> Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</p>
                           <p>In short, <hi>Those</hi> Converts, whether brought into the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104659:102"/> Case was this: The <hi>Jewish</hi> part of them had been Educated under the <hi>Discipline</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi> The <hi>false Apostles</hi> told them they were yet under the <hi>bond</hi> of that Dispensation, and some were so simple and <hi>weak</hi> as to believe them. Hereupon they had still an eye to those Jewish <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> even in the <hi>use</hi> of Christ's own <hi>Institutions.</hi> They did <hi>Judaize</hi> in the Matter of Circumcision, and <hi>Paschatize</hi> in the Use of the Lord's <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> wherein they had a greater <hi>veneration</hi> and respect for their old <hi>Passover</hi> than for Christ's <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and for this reason<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</hi> Ad 1 Cor. 11.29.</note> the Apostle taxeth them, That in the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, They did <hi>not discern the Lord's Body.</hi> By this means the Apostle tells them they did <hi>renounce</hi> their part in Christ, and were <hi>faln from Grace,</hi> (Gal. 5.2, 4.) And he says, as ill things of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For by the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of their Religion, and particularly by their <hi>Feasts</hi> in the <hi>Idols</hi> Temple, they held a <hi>Communion</hi> with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Now to see such as had taken upon them the Profession of Christianity, play the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in addicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Institutions, Rites,</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> of <hi>that</hi> Religion and Worship, which <hi>those Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles respectively</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and practise, This was such a <hi>Scandal</hi> to the Conscientious and weak Disciples, the Apostle could not dissemble the resentment of it; but tells them plainly, They did <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce</hi>

                           <p>That <hi>Synod</hi> gave an Example to after Ages, and taught them by Experience what course is best to follow; and 'tis that which all <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches do observe to this day.

                           <p>The Apostle therefore does not enjoyn the Prince to lay aside his <hi>Sword</hi> to make Peace; nor will he lay by his own <hi>Rod,</hi> when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion serves to use it, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. last.) for <hi>that</hi> is design'd for <hi>Edification</hi> as well as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekness, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.)

A Liberty <hi>to serve God acceptably</hi> (in all instances of the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Table) <hi>with reverence and Godly fear?</hi> Hebr. 12.28. To this purpose Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. I must tell my weak Brother, that Christ hath establisht a <hi>Church,</hi> and placed

                           <p>I may add for the further information of such a <hi>Brother.</hi> That God expects, a <hi>solemn Publick</hi> Worship should be <hi>settled</hi> in his

                           <p>Besides, I will tell this Brother, I cannot go to Church and be at home at the same time; no more than I can make both parts
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104659:115"/> of a Contradiction true: Wherefore that I may not continue pendulous, and be ever in suspense, and so make no use at all of my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, I must determine my self one way or other. But if the Church, which I take to be wiser than my self, shall in some instances (as she sees occasion) determine for me, I will dutifully submit my self to her Authority. And he walks very uncharitably, who takes upon him to censure my Practice, or judge my Conscience for so doing.<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ferus</hi> ad Rom. 14.</note> For I know it is not this carnal liberty of the flesh (to do or not to do) that makes me a Christian; But Righteousness and Peace, Humility, and other Virtues of Religion. And upon a full exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Particulars, I am very well satisfied that the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in use among us, are not <hi>introductive</hi> to any <hi>false</hi> Religion or Worship; but rather a <hi>Bar</hi> against it, (even against that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant (and by no man else) it is most suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to favour.) They gratifie neither the Opinion of the <hi>Jew,</hi> nor of the <hi>Gentile;</hi> They lead neither to Idolatry, nor Superstition; They are not ridiculous for any levity that is in them; nor burdensome for their number; and in short, they are not sinful; because against no Law; for Sin is the Transgression of a Law; and where no Law is, there is no Transgression.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. 'Tis the supposition of our Author, <hi>that this Liberty must hold</hi> in utram{que} partem, <hi>that

From hence I infer, that our Christian Liberty is more infringed by the <hi>Dogmatical Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Dissenting</hi> Teachers, than by the <hi>Prudent</hi> and <hi>Regular Impositions</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Governours.

                           <p>Conscience, I confess, is a <hi>Centurion</hi> of great Command; but yet 'tis under another Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and must be <hi>accountable</hi> for her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104659:121"/> Nor is her <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Privilege</hi> so great as is imagined. For the whole Nature and force of <hi>Conscience</hi> is exprest in a <hi>Practical Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,</hi> which consists of <hi>three</hi> Propositions according to the <hi>three</hi> Offices of Conscience. For instance; <hi>He that will not obey the Church, is to be treated as a Publican and a Heathen:</hi> This is the <hi>Major</hi> Proposition, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's express Revelation. But <hi>thou do'st not obey the Church:</hi> This is the <hi>Minor</hi> Proposition, produced and attested by the Conscience. Therefore <hi>Thou art to be treated as a Publican and a Heathen.</hi> This is the <hi>Third</hi> Proposition or <hi>Conclusion</hi> inserr'd from the other Two.</p>
                           <p>By this instance we see Conscience hath a <hi>threefold</hi> Office. 1. To <hi>Dictate</hi> and declare the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Law. This is call'd <hi>Synteresis.</hi> The Second is to <hi>Record</hi> and declare Matters of <hi>Fact;</hi> and this is call'd <hi>Syneidesis.</hi> The Third is to give <hi>Sentence</hi> according to the merits or demerits of the <hi>Cause,</hi> and so to determine the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Person; and this is called <hi>Crisis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Here is all the Power that Conscience hath; And 'tis clear that Conscience hath no Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>any</hi> of these Offices. Not in the <hi>First:</hi> not a Liberty to <hi>call evil Good,</hi> or <hi>Good evil:</hi> not a Liberty to <hi>dictate</hi> or declare what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man please to be the sence or letter of the Law; for then it should have a Liberty to <hi>erre</hi> and to <hi>deceive,</hi> by <hi>imposing</hi> that for a <hi>Rule</hi> of Law, which is not so. For Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104659:122"/> (in this Notion, that is, the <hi>Synteresis</hi>) is obliged to take direction from the <hi>Light of Reason,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations</hi> of God's Will, and from <hi>Humane Laws</hi> consonant thereto (for <hi>such</hi> Laws made by persons <hi>set over us</hi> in God's stead, must be obeyed <hi>for the Lord's sake:</hi>) if the Conscience directs <hi>otherwise,</hi> it is <hi>erroneous,</hi> and leads to Sin, and binds over to Damnation, till it be corrected, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come conformable to its Rule.</p>
                           <p>Nor has the Conscience any Liberty in the <hi>Second</hi> Office, in <hi>reporting</hi> Matters of <hi>Fact;</hi> for then it should have Liberty to <hi>misinform</hi> or <hi>tell</hi> a <hi>lie,</hi> in representing Matters of <hi>Fact</hi> otherwise than they are. Nor has Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science any Liberty in the <hi>Third</hi> Office, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the <hi>Case;</hi> for then it should have Liberty to be an <hi>unjust judge,</hi> to absolve or Condemn; that is, to <hi>pass Sentence</hi> contrary to the <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Verdict.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis true an <hi>evil</hi> Conscience may, <hi>now,</hi> make use of many <hi>shifts, tergiverses,</hi> and <hi>eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi> but at the <hi>Grand Assize,</hi> (or time of Judgment) God will beat it off from all its <hi>Subterfuges,</hi> and <hi>starting holes,</hi> He will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi> and <hi>refine</hi> it, and make it a <hi>faithful Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan</hi> to him in <hi>that</hi> exercise of his Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For then the <hi>Synteresis,</hi> (call'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>the inward man</hi>) shall fully <hi>consent</hi> to the Law of God, that it is <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Just,</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> And for the <hi>breach</hi> of that Law (which is Matter of Fact) it will be a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

                           <p>But we have a more pregnant instance than this to our purpose. We read (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10.) when Prayer to Almighty God was interdicted, <hi>Daniel</hi> went into his House, and <hi>opening his Windows</hi> towards <hi>Jerusalem, He Kneeled down and Prayed.</hi> The <hi>opening</hi> of his Windows was an open <hi>Protestation</hi> of his Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104659:165"/> but to <hi>give light</hi> to his Profession and Practice. <hi>Hic erat Confessionis casus,</hi> saith our <hi>Synopsis,</hi> Here was a Case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: and so saith <hi>Lyserus,</hi> in his <hi>Aulá Persicâ,</hi> p. 57, &amp;c. <hi>Fidem suam egregid Confessione testatur,</hi> saith <hi>Oecolampadius</hi>
                              <note n="*" place="margin">Ad <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.11.</note>; He testifies his Faith by an egregious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.

                           <p>And no doubt the holy Prophet <hi>opened</hi> his Windows, that by this <hi>help</hi> (saith he) he might consult his own <hi>Infirmity,</hi> and stir up himself to a greater <hi>Liveliness</hi> of Faith and <hi>ardour</hi> of devotion.

                              </note>, long before him, exhorts the Christians after this manner; Let us not <hi>be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104659:167"/> asham'd</hi> of Christ crucified; but with our fingers let us imprint the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> upon our Foreheads.</p>
                           <p>By these, and a multitude of other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, which might be produced, 'tis evident that the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been lookt upon as a <hi>Real Confession</hi> of the Faith of Christ crucified, and a <hi>symbolical Protestation</hi> of it; so that we may sum up our Discourse in short after this manner:</p>
                           <p>Confession is an Act of <hi>external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> under a <hi>General</hi> command of Christ, which does bind <hi>Semper,</hi> though not <hi>Ad semper;</hi> and consequently the Duty is <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies</hi> lawful, though not <hi>alwaies</hi> (in prudence) practicable. (2) That a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Command comprehends all <hi>particular</hi> Instances. (3) That the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> is one Instance of Confession, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Authority and Practice of the Church. From which premisses it will unavoidably follow, that we are under an obligation to observe it.</p>
                           <p>And indeed there is sometimes <hi>a necessity</hi> for it; for a confession by <hi>word of mouth,</hi> or by <hi>subscription,</hi> is neither practicable nor possible, at all <hi>Times,</hi> by all <hi>Persons,</hi> in all <hi>Places.</hi> Some have their Tongues <hi>cut out,</hi> some are <hi>mute</hi> and <hi>speechless,</hi> some are among <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who understand not their Language. Some other way
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104659:167"/> therefore is to be pitcht upon; and what should <hi>that</hi> be, rather then what may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be concluded from such intimations of Holy Writ as these: <hi>Looking at Jesus, who endured the Cross, despising the shame:</hi> (And) <hi>I have determined to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but Christ and him crucified;</hi> (and) <hi>God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> (and) <hi>If any man will be my Disciple, let him deny himself, take up his Cross and follow me.</hi>

                              </q> It may be, that to men who never lived abroad amongst <hi>Ʋnbelievers,</hi> nor considered the state of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, in which <hi>this</hi> Practice first prevailed, it may seem a very useless and empty Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to make this <hi>Sign</hi> upon an <hi>Infants</hi> Forehead at his reception into Christ's Flock; much more for a man in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to do it upon his own <hi>Breast:</hi> but for my own part I shall rather for ever esteem it as an <hi>Ʋniversal Character</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> forasmuch as it is sufficient to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104659:168"/> signifie throughout the <hi>whole</hi> World (when no other Language is mutually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) that the Person so sign'd is <hi>own'd,</hi> or <hi>owns himself</hi> to be a Member of Christ's <hi>Mystical</hi> Body.<note place="margin">See <hi>Tertul</hi> de <hi>Cornu Militis,</hi> cap. 3.</note> And therefore many of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians were <hi>branded</hi> with a Cross, and the <hi>Walls</hi> of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Castles, and Houses (as we see some yet remaining <hi>in many places</hi> to this very day) bore this <hi>Mark</hi> upon them, only as a note of <hi>distinction</hi> at first, though the <hi>Superstition</hi> indeed of succeeding Ages much altered the <hi>Original</hi> intent of it.

                     <p>IF proportionably to the grief, we have conceived at your Letters, (wherein you have expressed the most sad face of your Affaires,) we had but as much Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either by our Consolations to asswage your sorrows, or by our Counsels to ease your Burthens, or by any our Co-operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to help your Extremity, we should think our selves very happy in so well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding with your Honourable, and most loving <hi>Compellation</hi> of us; and right glad we should be thus to requite you with our best and effectual good Offices. But alass, as the scantness of our Capacity in this kind, so the ignorance of the more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward causes</hi> of so many miseries, and chiefly <hi>the perplex and dangerous Nature of the matters now in Agitation among you:</hi> All these put together, strike us quite dumb: we are as men wholly at a stand, able only (in a kind of silent Astonishment or holy horrour) to admire, and to adore <hi>that finger of God,</hi> which is now lifted up over you all.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104659:189"/>
                     <p>But since, being by you so lovingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to it, we must needs at last break off our silence, we are reduced to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>suspense both</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> and of <hi>pens,</hi> what to say first or last, or indeed what to say at all.</p>
                     <p>And now in the end, after long delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lest, as <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, we should transgress by precipitate or unseasonable discourse: Behold our Hearts and Mouths top-full of the Senses and Expressions of our hearty Commisseration, our Eyes running down with Tears of Compassion, our Breasts even swol'n up with Sighs and Groans at your Calamities. These are they, God is our Witness, that fill up the greatest part of our private Prayers, of our publick Devotions, Fastings and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: In all which we are resolved to give the Father of mercies no rest, untill your Tranquility being once more Ordained in Heaven, God do extend peace upon Earth unto you all like a River, and the fulness of his blessing, like an overflowing stream.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Our</hi> Affaires, yea, the <hi>general interest</hi> of all the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches are so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>involved</hi> in yours, and so mutually <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending</hi> thereon, That <hi>your safety once</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured assures <hi>us all</hi> of our <hi>own</hi> good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states. Therefore especially during this grevious Tempest, which may seem to

                  <p>Can there be any reason or good Policy to cut of the locks of this Spouse of Christ, and Ecclipse her Glory?

                  <p>We are taught also by a dear experience that such a dispensation will breed division: for a division in Laws makes<note n="†" place="margin">Oliver Ormerod. Puritano-Papismus. <hi>p. 29.</hi>

                     <hi>And as the present Case standeth, it may be doubted, whether they, or the</hi> Jesuites <hi>do offer more danger, or be more speedily to be repressed. For albeit the</hi> Jesuites <hi>do impoyson the hearts of her Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, under a pretence of Conscience, to withdraw them from obedience due to her Majesty; yet do they the same but closely; and only in privy Corners. But these men do both publish in their printed Books, and teach in all their Conventicles sundry Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; not only dangerous to the well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Estate, and Policy of this Realm, by putting a Pyke, between the Clergy and the Laity, but also much derogatory to her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty and her Crown, as well by the diminution of her antient and lawful Revenues, and by denying her Highnesses Prerogative and Supremacy, as by offering peril to her Majesties safety in her own Kingdom. In all which things, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in many other points, they pretend to be at War with the</hi> Popish-Jesuites; <hi>yet by this Seperation of themselves from the Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their fellow Subjects, and by aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Sacred Authority and Majesty of their Prince, they do but joyn and concur

                  <p>But if she were now alive might she not find just cause to expostulate with Subjects, as our Saviour did some time with his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</hi> You call me Renownd and Glorious, a Queen of Blessed Memory, and you honour me with a piece of Formal Pageantry;<note n="*" place="margin">

That our hearts are not frought with the like Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as theirs was, and that we do not govern our selves by the same Principles of Duty and honour as they did?</p>
                  <p>For shame let every man lay his hand upon his heart, and consult his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and be awakned to some degree of temper and sobriety; for 'tis as clear as

                  <p n="3">3. My Third Proof of this <hi>Assertion</hi> may be found in a late Book, being, <hi>A short view of our late Troubles:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, any man (that desires a full and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial account of those affairs,) may please to Consult the <hi>Parallel</hi> in the Second Chapter.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:104659:204"/>
                  <p>Lastly, We do affirm, That these <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi> and such as so eagerly abet them, doe carry on that very design, which they pretend to abhor with so great a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station in the <hi>Jesuites.</hi> And in order to the proof of this, let me take leave to propound a question, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether to abolish those Decent <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> which were generally in use in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> Ages of the Church, and to grant a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all Religions; or, to allow <hi>Conventicles</hi> for the free and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship of <hi>Protestant-Dissenters</hi> (as they will needs call themselves) be not an Argument of great <hi>Levity,</hi> a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> a <hi>Scandal</hi> to our <hi>own</hi> and <hi>forreign</hi> Churches, and a means as well to betray our own professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to gratify the Common Enemy, by Complying with such Methods as they have from time to time, contrived and practised, for the Subversion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which through Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, hath been so happily <hi>Reform'd</hi> and setled, and so long preserv'd and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, to the envy of some, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of others of our Neighbours?</p>
                  <p>The Reason of this Quere is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is the practice of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Party</hi> to promote <hi>Change</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> among us; and then to disparage our Religion upon the account of <hi>Novelty.</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:104659:204"/> And by that Argument many times they prevail to make <hi>Proselites,</hi> and to draw men from the Communion of our Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because they have made it their great business to purchase a <hi>Toleration;</hi> and to this effect, they have used all the Arts of <hi>Bribery</hi> and Crafty Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because it is a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> and clearly evident, that their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> creep into <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make use of such Meeting to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Nation.</p>
                  <p>For all which we have sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that solemnly deposed upon the <hi>Corporal</hi> Oaths of the King's <hi>Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That they did not doubt but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Toleration of Religions, by which they should bring it in without noise.</hi>

But suppose the Parliament will not be brib'd? Why? It is the same thing in effect, whether we be <hi>brib'd</hi> by <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jol'd</hi> by <hi>Dissenters,</hi> who have imbib'd their infusions; whether we take <hi>Money,</hi> or be <hi>insnar'd</hi> by insinuation; if we deny a <hi>Toleration,</hi> yet if we set open a <hi>Door</hi> to <hi>Conventicles,</hi> we give them as fair an opportunity to do their business, as if a <hi>Toleration</hi> were granted.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Popish</hi> Plot is carried on by the <hi>Schismatick</hi> (whom he calls the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi> in <hi>Masquerade,</hi>) is noted by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavil Redivivus (p. 68.)

                  <p>I remember Mr. <hi>Ormerod</hi> near Four Score Years ago, having made a <hi>Parallel</hi> betwixt the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Dissenters</hi> of those times, concludes his Address to them in these words; <q>And thus I leave you, wishing first of all your Conformity: if that cannot be had, my next wish is, that you were dealt withal, as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> dealt with two of his Subjects, in whom there was little hope of Grace; he made one of them to run out of the Countrey, and the other to drive him, so his People were rid of both. But this shall not be my Conclusion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Dissenters</hi> would have us comply with them: But in what? In the Change of Government and Discipline in the Church according to their Fancies? in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Forms of God's Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, with the Rites of Decency and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to promote the same?

                     </gap> Conscience gratify this their humour against the general Rules of Holy Scripture, the light of Reason, the Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of the Primitive Church, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense of the most Sober and Learned Protestants.</p>
                  <p>What then? Would they have us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the practices of the Jesuites? With all our hearts.</p>

                  <p>But we must remember the Jesuites have two Heads of Doctrine, both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to the Principles of Christianity, wherein we utterly dissent from them. The first in reference to God's Worship and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; the second in reference to the King, his Crown and Government. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the whole: let them do so likewise; else let them be lookt upon as <hi>Parcel-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites;</hi> for such they are, unless they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce not only such Doctrines as lead to <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi> but such also as lead to <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Let them say the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and let them say the same (as the Apostle does, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.4.) of every <hi>Adversary,</hi>

                  <p>These are <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Doctrines, and we desire they may joyn with us in a hearty Renunciation of them.

Let them therefore <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> to the Laws establisht, and joyn with us in the performance of God's <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Solemn</hi> Worship.
